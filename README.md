BIOGRAPHY
I am 25, and live in Canada with my girlfriend in a two bedroom apartment with our two cats, Kira and Floki. I grew up in a small town, and moved to a city just
after highschool. I have been working labor jobs since was 12, and had no direction for what I wanted to do as a career. Although I have recently started a job that
could lead to a career within the company, it still doesn't feel right for me. It's one of those things where I would stick it out just because I have nothing else
to follow.

In my free time I like to play video games, watch tv shows - not so much movies as I find them to be too long to hold my attention, and work with my hands. I've tried 
many hobbies: drawing, calligraphy, woodcarving, soapstone carving, pyrography, building models, painting minis, cross stitching, crocheting, writing stories.. I'm sure
there are a few that I am forgetting. But the most recent one that I have been doing is leatherworking. I have made a few projects so far and am still enjoying it,
although I don't dedicate as much time towards it as I would like to. But now that I am starting to get into coding, I'm sure all of my free time will be taken up by that.

One of my goals is to travel, and I think the best way for me to do that will be to get a job that allows me to work remotely. For the longest time I didn't
want anything to do with coding, so I tried to find anything else that I could do on the computer remotely. That just led me to running in circles between feeling lost
and giving up on my dream for while beacuse I felt it was impossible for me. Eventually I found out about web development/design. I saw that it was still surrounded by
code, and I realized that there was no way around it if I wanted to achieve my goal. I saw that it was something that would allow me to use my creativity skills, and
make something practical that would help people progress their business. So not only would I be allowed to be creative, but I could create something useful for others.

The perfect fit.

So that was the start of my journey to learn web development/design. I know that this will be a long journey full of headaches and set backs, but if I can stick this
out, I know that I will be able to live the life that I have always dreamed of.
